existing installation.

CI's config.php
===============

If you used our config_demo.php file for your CI installation, you'll prefer
to remove a line in the config.php:

	$config['date_format']

Some comments have been added to this file in the Session Variables section.
Please have a look at them.

We remind you that the FAL_auto_login_period key is not used.

Value changes
-------------
FAL_captcha_base_image_path:
we changed it from public/images/captcha/ to
	$config['FAL_assets'].'/'.$config['FAL_images'].'/captcha/'.
If you use the basic setting, everything will be fine, but else you'll
know what to do...

Forms have been moved to the $config['FAL_template_dir'].'content/forms'
directory. So if you kept basic settings, please copy-paste the VIEW SETTINGS
until // CAPTCHA VIEW to your freakauth_light.php file.

Additions
---------
Those sections have been added:

    * Enable/Disable FreakAuth light extensions
    * Whether the registration/activation process requires e-mail verification
    * Directory for FreakAuth_light views assets

This line has been added:

$config['FAL_captcha_img_tag_view'] = $config['FAL_template_dir'].'content/forms/html_for_captcha';

==============
| Form Views |
==============

We moved (with modifications) those four view files

    * application/views/FreakAuth_light/content/change_password.php
    * application/views/FreakAuth_light/content/forgotten_password.php
    * application/views/FreakAuth_light/content/login.php
    * application/views/FreakAuth_light/content/register.php

to

    * application/views/FreakAuth_light/content/forms/change_password.php
    * application/views/FreakAuth_light/content/forms/forgotten_password.php
    * application/views/FreakAuth_light/content/forms/login.php
    * application/views/FreakAuth_light/content/forms/register.php

====================
| Functional Files |
====================

If you just want to upload the new files or the one that have been changed,
take care of those:

modified
    * application/controllers/admin/admins.php
    * application/controllers/admin/example.php
    * application/controllers/admin/users.php
    * application/controllers/installer.php
    * application/helpers/freakauth_light_helper.php
    * application/libraries/FAL_validation.php
    * application/libraries/Freakauth_light.php
    * application/views/FreakAuth_light/template_admin/users/add.php
    * application/views/FreakAuth_light/template_admin/users/detail.php
    * application/views/FreakAuth_light/template_admin/users/edit.php
    * application/views/FreakAuth_light/template_admin/users/list.php
    * application/models/FreakAuth_light/usertemp.php
    * application/models/usermodel.php

new
    * application/views/FreakAuth_light/content/forms/html_for_captcha.php

=================
| Public Folder |
=================

Create those folders in /public:
frontend, frontend/css, admin, admin/css, and shared, then

    * move public/css/fal_style.css into public/frontend/css/
    * move the public/css/images folder to public/frontend/css/images

    * move public/css/admin_console.css into public/admin/css/
    * move and rename the public/css/images_adminconsole folder to public/admin/images

If you used our admin_console.css, replace the old one by the new one.
If you used yours, you will know better than we do what to do:

     just replace images_adminconsole occurences with ../images (4 occurences)
     images_adminconsole/arrow.gif with ../../shared/images/arrow.gif (1)
     images/error.png with ../../shared/images/error.png (1)

    * remove the old public/css folder

    * move the public/js folder to public/shared/js

If you do not want to adopt the new assets folder structure, simply change the
TEMPLATE SETTINGS in application/config/freakauth_light.php in order to make
them accomplish your needs!

If you change the default TEMPLATE SETTINGS, remember to edit the CSS files in
order to make them point to the right folders were you put your images.
