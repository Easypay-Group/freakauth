/*-------------------------------------+
|  FREAKAUTH_LIGHT 1.0.4 (16/05/2007)  |
+-------------------------------------*/
The main change here is that while in version 1.0.3 we reached views abstraction,
with versio 1.0.4 we also reached controllers name abstraction. Namely now you can
build multiple controllers, each of them handling one different action (i.e. one controller
for login/logout, one for changepassword etc.).

We also corrected some other stuff reported in FAL_1.0.3 like:
----------------
DENY PROCESS
----------------
[206] 	fixed the deny process (denyAccess() function) see #33
[215] [217] in the deny process, if a visitor comes with no http_referer, now sent to FAL_denied_from_ext_location
----------------
CHANGE PASSWORD 
----------------
[169] 	fixes #18 (validation error messages in change pass), I also cleaned the set_fields() and set_rules() calls: dispatched them nicely in the functions instead of a big call in the constructor. Added a config key for forgotten pass email validation. changepassword() now calls the right lang keys.
[183] reworked concistency of the password rules (register and change password) removed the hardcoded rules and added the match rule to the one in the config file note: breaks the change_password template (see the keys of the password fields)
[196] 	 fixes #14: changepassword wrong error message. I added a lang item and made a redirect()
----------------
OTHER PROCESSES
----------------
[163] 	"improved security --> corrected password fields redisplay upon submission error "
[170] 	fixes #21: installer now displays directly the insertion of the superadmin (just added a redirect()
[178], [179], [184] to [193], [202], [210] "added variables to fix ticket #13" in order to make the library not only template independent, but even controller/method naming abstract
[213] 	changed occurences of $this->uri->ruri_string() to $this->uri->uri_string() in views (form action) because if I reroute my uri (ie route['login']="auth/login") I don't want that upon form validation failure the rerouted uri gets displayed
----------------
VISUALS 
----------------
[174] 	added a <br /> in some content view files to separate a bit the 'continue' link
[197] [205] changed views register.php and changepassword.php in order to fit longer labels
[203] [209] added changePassword definition in fal_style.css and modified change_password view
[208] 	"changed .error style in fal_style.css to #FF3300->more flashy"
[214] 	merged the pre and code selectors and monospaced them
[216] 	added a comma and unwrap tags in the emails
----------------
TYPO FIXES 
----------------
[168] 	fixed the FrekAuth typo in welcome controller
[171] 	fixed the passoword typo
[172] 	html validation fix: </p> instead of <p>
[173] 	typo in activation email, removed a '+'
[175] 	removing a useless '</td>' in an admin template
[176] 	fixed a typo between banned and country_id in a template file
[180] 	fixed the lenght typo
[211] 	fixed the Frek typo in the installer
[212] 	"eliminating a <br> present in fal_style.css"
----------------
MISC 
----------------
[165] 	erase the security code from the db_session just after checking (see #20)
[167] 	fixed font path for the captcha, now uses BASEPATH
[177] 	adding id attributes to the form tags for login, register, forgotten password and change password forms
[194] 	"eliminated transactions from FreakAuth_light.php library method activation () "
[195] 	eliminated unused method password_change_check() from FAL_validation library
[199] [200] 	"cleaned up installer from redundant validation stuff already in FAL_validation"
[198] [204] 	changed method name deny() to denyAccess() in Freakauth_light.php, and updated all calls to this method to use the new name
[207] 	changed methods naming in Freakauth_light lib: from _generateRandomSecurityCodeImage to _generateCaptcha and from _deleteOldSecurityCodeImage to _deleteOldCaptcha




/*------------------------------------+
